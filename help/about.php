    <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>The objective of this test is to quantify the feasibility and performance of a proposed talent-to-assignment matching algorithm, in contrast to the status quo assignment process.  Please keep in mind that is only a test and will have no bearing on the actual VML cycle, as the FY17 Summer VML has already closed. Keeping that in mind, we ask that you participate as if this new assignment system is part has already been implemented.  The more accurate and quantifiable data we can collect, the better we can make recommendations to Air Force leadership. </p>
    <h3>Testing a new talent matching algorithm</h3>
        <p>The backbone of this assignment system is to test a talent matching algorithm that maximizes satisfaction between both officers and the billet owners themselves. This algorithm has been used successfully for nearly 50 years by the <a href="http://www.nrmp.org/match-process/match-algorithm/"> National Residency Matching Program</a>, the process by which graduating medical students are awarded their initial placement in hospitals. </p> 
        
        <p> To allow the algorithm to function at its maximum potential, it requires cooperation from both parties.  Officers need to create a 1-to-n list of assignments that they want, and billet owners need to create a 1-to-n list of officers that they want.  The proposed algorithm would then require further modifications by the AFPC Assignment Team as necessary to incorporate additional constraints such as unit manning requirements.</p>
    <h3>Helping officers "shop" for their next assignment</h3>
        <p>To aid in the creation of preferential assignment lists, this test also incorporates an improved way to "shop" for assignments compared to the current AMS system.  The <a href="../billets/find.php">Find a Billet</a> link allows officers to filter and view details about the assignments that are available.  As you will notice, the information listed for each assignment is more than what is typically shown for assignments during your past VML cycles.  This information is collected from the billet owners themselves using the <a href="../billets/manage.php">Manage Billets</a> link.  As such if you are a billet owner, please provide as much detail about the assignment as possible, since this will allow officers to focus on assignments that are most suitable for their careers, and ultimately the Air Force.</p>
    <h3>Helping billet owners find the right officers</h3>
        <p>To aid billet owners in finding for potential officers, the existing <a href="https://afvec.langley.af.mil/myvector/" target="_blank">MyVector</a> website has the list of available officers along with their work history, skill sets, etc. If you an officer on the VML, you will need to log into <a href="https://afvec.langley.af.mil/myvector/" target="_blank">MyVector</a> and fill out your profile with as much information regarding your talents, skills, expertise, and anything that will make you look favorable as billet owners search through the website to build their preferred officer list.  This process emulates a LinkedIn environment where billet owners can quickly review and rank multiple candidates for their positions.</p>
        
    <h3>Deadlines</h3>
        <p>Officers to provide information on themselves via <a href="https://afvec.langley.af.mil/myvector/" target="_blank">MyVector</a>. Billet owners to provide information on their assignments via <a href="../billets/manage.php">Manage Billets</a>. <b>Deadline: 31 January 2017</b></p>
        
        <p>Officers to input their preferred assignment list. Billet owners to input their preferred officers list.  This is done via the <a href="/prefs/input.php">My Preference List</a> link.  <b>Deadline: 3 March 2017</b></p>
