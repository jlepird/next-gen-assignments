        <p>The objective of this study is to quantify differences between the status quo assignment
           process and the proposed algorithmic system.  This contrast will be measured using</p>
           statistics such as the following:</p>
            <ul>Number of officers given their first, second, third etc. assignment
                preferences under each system.</ul>
            <ul>Number of commanders given their first, second, third, etc. assignment
                preferences under each system.</ul>
            <ul>Sentiment surveys of affected officers, commanders, and units.</ul>
            <ul>Compliance rate with applicable assignment policy, to include policies derived
                from public law, joint regulations, Air Force Instructions, and the applicable
                Career Field Manager (CFM).</ul>
